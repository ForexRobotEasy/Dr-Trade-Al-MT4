## How it Works

The Expert Advisor is initialized using the `OnInit()` function, which retrieves the current account balance and initializes the trade counter. 

In the `OnTick()` function, the EA checks if the maximum number of open trades has been reached. If not, it calculates the lot size based on the risk percentage and account balance. It also calculates the stop loss and take profit levels based on the input parameters.

The EA then checks the market conditions using the `MarketCondition()` function and executes trading decisions accordingly. If the market condition indicates a buy signal, the EA executes a buy trade using the `BuyTrade()` function. If the market condition indicates a sell signal, the EA executes a sell trade using the `SellTrade()` function.

The `MarketCondition()`, `BuyTrade()`, and `SellTrade()` functions are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual logic for determining market conditions and executing trades.

The `OnDeinit()` function is triggered when the EA is stopped and it prints the total number of trades executed.
